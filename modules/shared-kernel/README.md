## âœ¨ Features

The shared kernel concept is not directly related to clean architecture: it's a domain-driven design concept that aims to describe a sharing pattern between different contexts and teams.  
In domain-driven design, a shared kernel is a special type of bounded context that contains code and data shared across multiple bounded contexts within the same domain.  
It acts as a central repository for ubiquitous language elements, domain logic, and data structures that are common to all or a subset of the bounded contexts.  
It should be kept as small as possible since any change will need synchronization with impacted consumers.
