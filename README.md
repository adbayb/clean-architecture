# frontend-clean-architecture

A frontend clean architecture proposal to enforce a loosely coupled business logic. 
A modular design with a [screaming architecture file structure](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2011/09/30/Screaming-Architecture.html) has been adopted to split the application into independent bounded contexts while making the file structure scream the intent of the application without looking at implementation details.
